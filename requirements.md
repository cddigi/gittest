On each User page, the information should be displayed in three different sections: User Info, Employer Info, Surveys.

All Users, Graduate Office Employees, and the Administrator should have a navigation area with the available actions that each type of user can accomplish. Only the Administrator will have the ability to add, update, and delete any account. A Graduate Office account can only add or update a User account.

Users need the ability to choose whether or not their information is associated with survey responses in order to keep their responses anonymous; ability to access their account settings and in some way opt-out of the following three categories of automated email that may be sent: All, Surveys, News.

There must be a password reset option. User passwords can be reset by Administrator or Graduate Office. Graduate Office password can only be reset by Administrator.

Users need the ability to submit opportunities to give back or help North Central College in some way. Possible options include internships, guest speaking, mentoring, or some other non-monetary form of assistance.

When this form is submitted, designated Graduate Office Employees will receive a notification so that they can decide if they want to follow up with the form.

### 3. Surveys

When Esers first sign log in they will need to fill out an entry survey. When they have graduated, an exit survey will become available. Graduate Office Employees will be able to track which users have not completed specific surveys. 

When a Eser logs into the system, a list of available surveys will be displayed. 

Graduate Office Employees need to be able to create new surveys with the option to make them available to certain groups of Users.

<strong>Graduate Office Employees:</strong><br />
Graduate Office Employees have the ability to search through the database information by any of the information that a User has provided to their account. After a search has been completed, the Office Employee should be able to save the search result in a Saved List. The information displayed in a search result should be limited to name, degree program, email, employer, graduation date, and any other fields the Office Employee used to search so as to not clutter the screen. The Saved Lists need to be exportable into an Excel spreadsheet, as well as exporting the emails for use in Groupwise.

<strong>Users:</strong><br />
The User has the ability to search for other Users if they have opted-in to searches from other Users. Only basic fields such as name and degree should be shown.
