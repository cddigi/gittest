All users, graduate office employees, and the administrator should have a navigation area with the available actions that each type of user can accomplish (Examples: Search, Surveys, Giving Back, Account Information, Employment Information).

There must be the ability for the user to choose whether or not their information is associated with survey responses in order to keep their responses anonymous.

There also must be the ability for the user to access their account settings and in some way opt-out of the following three categories of automated email that may be sent: All, Survey Information, News.

There also must be the ability for users to reset their password if they forget or for security reasons. Graduate office employees and the administrator can reset user passwords.

### 2b. Giving Back

There needs to be a way for users to submit opportunities to give back or help North Central College in some way. Possible options include internships, speaking, mentoring, or some other non-monetary form of assistance.

When this form is submitted, designated graduate office employees will receive a notification so that they can decide if they want to follow up with the opportunity.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 3. Surveys

When users first sign log in they will need to fill out an entry survey. When they have graduated, an exit survey will become available. Graduate office employees will be able to track which users have not filled out specific surveys. When a user logs into the system, a list of available surveys will be displayed. Graduate office employees need to be able to create new surveys with the option to make them available to certain users.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 4. Reports

There needs be the ability to create reports based on survey results and search queries with a number of preset options, as well as the ability to create custom reports. These should be able to be exported into Excel spreadsheet format for easier viewing and management.

There also needs to be an ability for administrators to export email addresses in order to send emails to users individually and to groups of users via Groupwise. The preferred format of this information is Excel spreadsheet.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 5. Admin

<strong>Users:</strong><br />

There needs to be the ability to create lists of names that are links to respective profiles for the graduate office employees to use in order to save names of those who they wish to follow up with or remember to contact at a later time. Graduate office employees should be able to have multiple, nameable lists with the ability to export the emails of these lists to Excel spreadsheet format.
